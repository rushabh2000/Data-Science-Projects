## Project 1: Using a dataset of diamonds, I trained a ridge regression model to predict the price of a diamond given a set of input features. In addition, I explored non-linear regression techniques as well.
## Project 2: Natural Language Processing - carried out the n-gram algorithm to identify the language of origin of mystery.txt from given samples of various laguages. I also explored the tfidf metric to identify the most distinctive word in a given article.
## Project 3: K-Means CLustering - The following project carries out k-means clustering which is a part of unsupervised learning.
## Project 4: Clustering based image segmentation - Using the kmeans algorithm, the project implements image segmentation of pupil located in the eye.
## Project 5: Using real life data containing student performance on an online course, I carried out data analysis by asking three key questions related to student performance and their video watching behavior.
