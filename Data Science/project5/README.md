# Student performance related to video-watching behavior

   
## 'behavior-performance.txt' contains data for an online course on how students watched videos (e.g., how much time they spent watching, how often they paused the video, etc.) and how they performed on in-video quizzes. , the analysis questions are as follows:

1. “How well can the students be naturally grouped or clustered by their video watching behavior (fracSpent, fracComp, fracPaused, numPauses, avgPBR, numRWs, and numFFs)? Using data of students that complete at least five of the videos in your analysis.”
2. “Can student's video-watching behavior be used to predict a student's performance (i.e., average scores across all quizzes)?  Using all students that complete at least half of the quizzes in the analysis”.
3. “How well can you predict a student's performance on a particular in-video quiz question (i.e., whether they will be correct or incorrect) based on their video-watching behaviors while watching the corresponding video?. Using all student pairs in the dataset carry out the analysis”
